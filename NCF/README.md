# Neural Collaborative Filtering

This is the implementation for the paper:

Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua (2017). [Neural Collaborative Filtering.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3052569) In Proceedings of WWW '17, Perth, Australia, April 03-07, 2017.

Three collaborative filtering models: Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF). To target the models for implicit feedback and ranking task, we optimize them using log loss with negative sampling. 

**Please cite the WWW'17 paper if you use the codes. Thanks!** 


## Example to run the codes.
The instruction of commands has been clearly stated in the codes (see the  parse_args function). 


Run MLP:
```
python MLP.py --dataset ml-1m --epochs 20 --batch_size 256 --layers [64,32,16,8] --reg_layers [0,0,0,0] --num_neg 4 --lr 0.001 --learner adam --verbose 1 --out 1
```


## Dataset
I provide two processed datasets: MovieLens 1 Million (ml-1m) and Pinterest (pinterest-20). 

train.rating: 
- Train file.
- Each Line is a training instance: userID\t itemID\t rating\t timestamp (if have)

test.rating:
- Test file (positive instances). 
- Each Line is a testing instance: userID\t itemID\t rating\t timestamp (if have)

test.negative
- Test file (negative instances).
- Each line corresponds to the line of test.rating, containing 99 negative samples.  
- Each line is in the format: (userID,itemID)\t negativeItemID1\t negativeItemID2 ...
